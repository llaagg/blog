Based on great article from Joel Spolsky's blog - made in August 9, 2000 by Joel Spolsky, this post revisits and updates the concepts discussed in the original article.

The Joel Test modified and refreshed for modern software development practices. I've allowed to rename and adapt the questions to better fit contemporary development workflows. Points which were modifed from the orgiginal post:
- Question 2: Updated to focus on automated build processes.
- Question 3: Updated to emphasize automated daily builds.
- Question 4: Shifted from a bug database to a broader work management tool.
- Question 10: Changed from having testers to having automated tests.
- Question 12: Updated from hallway usability testing to using design from a UX designer.


## Updated Joel Test

1. Do you use source control?

Self explanatory if you are using source control.

2. Do you have an automated build process?

You have a file that automates the build process (some yaml in pipelines)

3. Do you have automated daily builds?

You should be making daily builds to catch integration issues early. And this build starts e2e integration tests automatically.

4. Do you use a work management tool?

You should have a centralized bug database to track and manage all reported issues. With work management tool. Bugs should be linked to tasks and they should receive a priority and be fixed accordingly.

5. Do you fix bugs before writing new code?

Iterative approach ensures that bugs are addressed promptly before new features are added, maintaining code quality and stability.

6. Do you have an up-to-date schedule?

You should have a plan for next iteration and keep your schedule up-to-date to reflect any changes in priorities or timelines. Even if priorities will change they should be reflected in backlog (on epic or other high  level)

7. Do you have a spec? 

All tasks are estimated by all team members collectively, ensuring that everyone has a shared understanding of the effort required and potential challenges. Ask for estimates allows that everyone has understanding on what the team is doing.

8. Do programmers have quiet working conditions?

Programmers should have a quiet and distraction-free environment to focus on their work, which helps improve productivity and code quality.

9. Do you use the best tools money can buy?

In line with company architecture and standards, ensuring that the tools used are the most effective and efficient for the development process. 

10. Do you have automated tests?

Do you have automated tests as part of your pipeline. Tests should be done in separted repository to ensure isolation and maintainability. Developers can contribute and use during implementation.

11. Do new candidates write code during their interview?

Simple coding exercise to evaluate the candidate's problem-solving skills and coding ability. In line with company expecations. 

12. Do you use design from UX designer?

You use design from UX designer in line with company guidelines and ensure that usability testing is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the design. You maintain a feedback loop to continuously improve the user experience based on the insights gathered from usability testing.
